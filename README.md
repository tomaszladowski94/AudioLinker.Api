AudioLinker

AudioLinker is a simple ASP.NET Core 8 web API for analyzing YouTube video links.

This project currently includes:

An endpoint to analyze a video URL and extract its ID.

Validation to ensure the URL is provided and correctly formatted.

Unit tests covering valid and invalid URLs.

This is the initial backend setup for a future YouTube-to-MP3 converter application.
